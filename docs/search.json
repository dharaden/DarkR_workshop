    "text": "1-Introduction: An Unexpected Journey\nDuring the first session, we plan to go over becoming more comfortable with R and making it your own. Note: When I refer to using R, I am really referring to using R-Studio (the GUI for R). This includes updating some of the default settings in R that will save your environment and all of your data. Having this enabled makes it difficult to practice reproducible coding. Additional steps will include setting up a project, getting familiar with the usage of packages and libraries, and loading in some data.\nOnce Dustin puts together some slides, they will be linked here:\n\nSlides for Session 1\nData for Session 1"

We will revisit how to bring data into the environment and then begin to talk about descriptives and cleaning. In addition, we will be working to create subscales since that is most of what our research tends to look at. Hopefully, we will be able to make some nice & pretty tables\nOnce the slides are done, they will go in these empty bullet points:"
